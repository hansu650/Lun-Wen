# FDAM: Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation

**[ICCV 2025]** Official implementation of *Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction* [(paper link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006).

FDAM revitalizes Vision Transformers by tackling frequency vanishing. It dynamically modulates the frequency response of attention layers, enabling the model to preserve critical details and textures for superior dense prediction performance.



# 📰 News

- **2025-10-10**: [Training code](./FDAM_mmseg) and weights for DeiT-III-Base on ADE20K are now available.
- **2025-10-16**: [机器之心 Report](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/eCN-0K5TQCX0nWA0CacWTQ).



## 🚀 Key Features

- **Attention Inversion (AttInv):** Inspired by circuit theory, AttInv inverts the inherent low-pass filter of the attention mechanism to generate a complementary high-pass filter, enabling a full-spectrum representation.
- **Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale):** Adaptively re-weights and amplifies different frequency bands in feature maps, providing fine-grained control to enhance crucial details like edges and textures.
- **Prevents Representation Collapse:** Effectively mitigates frequency vanishing and rank collapse in deep ViTs, leading to more diverse and discriminative features.
- **Plug-and-Play & Efficient:** Seamlessly integrates into existing ViT architectures (like DeiT, SegFormer, MaskDINO) with minimal computational overhead.

### ⚡ Quick Start: Plug-and-Play FDAM Integration

Integrating FDAM into your existing Vision Transformer is straightforward. The core idea is to replace the standard Attention with our AttentionwithAttInv and insert a GroupDynamicScale module after both the attention and MLP blocks. This enhances the model's ability to process frequency information with minimal code changes.

Below is a side-by-side comparison of a standard Transformer Block and our FDAM-enhanced Layer_scale_init_Block.

#### 1. Standard Transformer Block

A typical Block in a Vision Transformer looks like this:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from timm.models.layers import DropPath
from timm.models.vision_transformer import Attention, Mlp

class StandardBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, mlp_ratio=4., drop_path=0., norm_layer=nn.LayerNorm):
        super().__init__()
        self.norm1 = norm_layer(dim)
        self.attn = Attention(dim, num_heads=num_heads)
        self.drop_path = DropPath(drop_path) if drop_path > 0. else nn.Identity()
        self.norm2 = norm_layer(dim)
        self.mlp = Mlp(in_features=dim, hidden_features=int(dim * mlp_ratio))

    def forward(self, x):
        # Attention block
        x = x + self.drop_path(self.attn(self.norm1(x)))
        # MLP block
        x = x + self.drop_path(self.mlp(self.norm2(x)))
        return x
```

#### 2. Upgrading to an FDAM Block

To upgrade to FDAM, simply follow these three steps:

1. **Replace Attention with AttentionwithAttInv:** This module introduces a high-frequency path.
2. **Add GroupDynamicScale after attention:** This module performs frequency scaling on the features from the attention block.
3. **Add GroupDynamicScale after the MLP:** This scales the features from the MLP block.

Here is the code for our Layer_scale_init_Block, which encapsulates these changes:

```python
# Assuming AttentionwithAttInv and GroupDynamicScale are defined as in deit_fdam.py
# and utility functions nlc_to_nchw, nchw_to_nlc are available.

class FdamBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, num_heads, mlp_ratio=4., drop_path=0., norm_layer=nn.LayerNorm, init_values=1e-4):
        super().__init__()
        # --- Standard components ---
        self.norm1 = norm_layer(dim)
        self.drop_path = DropPath(drop_path) if drop_path > 0. else nn.Identity()
        self.norm2 = norm_layer(dim)
        self.mlp = Mlp(in_features=dim, hidden_features=int(dim * mlp_ratio))
        self.gamma_1 = nn.Parameter(init_values * torch.ones(dim))
        self.gamma_2 = nn.Parameter(init_values * torch.ones(dim))
        
        # --- FDAM-specific upgrades ---
        # 1. Replace Attention with AttentionwithAttInv
        self.attn = AttentionwithAttInv(dim, num_heads=num_heads)
        
        # 2. Add GroupDynamicScale after Attention and MLP
        self.freq_scale_1 = GroupDynamicScale(dim=dim)
        self.freq_scale_2 = GroupDynamicScale(dim=dim)

    def forward(self, x, H, W):
        # --- Attention block with FDAM ---
        x_att = self.attn(self.norm1(x))
        
        # Reshape for GroupDynamicScale (N, L, C) -> (N, C, H, W)
        x_att_reshaped = nlc_to_nchw(x_att, (H, W))
        x_att_scaled = self.freq_scale_1(x_att_reshaped) + x_att_reshaped
        x_att = nchw_to_nlc(x_att_scaled)
        
        x = x + self.drop_path(self.gamma_1 * x_att)

        # --- MLP block with FDAM ---
        x_mlp = self.mlp(self.norm2(x))

        # Reshape for GroupDynamicScale
        x_mlp_reshaped = nlc_to_nchw(x_mlp, (H, W))
        x_mlp_scaled = self.freq_scale_2(x_mlp_reshaped) + x_mlp_reshaped
        x_mlp = nchw_to_nlc(x_mlp_scaled)

        x = x + self.drop_path(self.gamma_2 * x_mlp)
        
        return x
```

By replacing your standard Block with this FDAM-enhanced FdamBlock (or our provided Layer_scale_init_Block), you can seamlessly integrate frequency-dynamic modulation into your Vision Transformer models.
