## 2026-05-06 dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple run01-run06 summary

- model: `dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple`
- change: Part 1-only DFormer-guided depth adapter simple fusion. It reuses stage-wise guided depth adaptation and removes Full++ rectification and attention aggregation.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`
- completed runs: `6`
- dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run01: best val/mIoU `0.511741` at recorded epoch `37`, last `0.490230`, best val/loss `1.017727` at recorded epoch `9`

- mean best val/mIoU: `0.512316`

- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run01.md`, `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run02.md`, `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run03.md`, `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run04.md`, `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run05.md`, `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_run06.md`, and `miou_list/dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple_summary_run01_06.md`
- conclusion: near-baseline but negative repeated-run result. The Part 1-only branch is healthier than Full++ and DGC-AF++ on mean best val/mIoU, but six runs do not beat the repeated DFormerv2 mid-fusion baseline mean.
- next step: do not claim this branch as a stable paper improvement. Keep it as evidence that early DFormer-guided depth adaptation is less harmful than the full chain, but the current adapter/residual design still needs either stronger stability control or a more conservative ablation before promotion.

## 2026-05-06 dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple run01-run03 summary

- model: `dformerv2_guided_depth_adapter_simple`
- change: Part 1-only DFormer-guided depth adapter simple fusion. It reuses stage-wise guided depth adaptation and removes Full++ rectification and attention aggregation.

- conclusion: promising three-run result. The Part 1-only simple branch is above the repeated DFormerv2 mid-fusion baseline mean and clearly above Full++ / DGC-AF++ means, suggesting the guided depth adapter is the useful part while later rectification/attention aggregation likely adds instability.
- next step: do not finalize the paper claim from only three runs. Extend to five repeated runs before promoting this as the main candidate; if the five-run mean remains above `0.513406`, keep Part 1-only as the primary new branch and treat Full++ as a negative complexity ablation.

- conclusion: negative repeated-run result. The new three-stage guided depth fusion has one strong run, but the five-run mean remains below the repeated DFormerv2 mid-fusion baseline and is essentially tied with DGC-AF++.
- next step: do not claim this branch as a paper improvement. Keep it as a meaningful negative ablation showing that stage-wise guided depth adaptation alone does not solve the instability; next direction should reduce complexity and isolate Part 1 / Part 2 / Part 3 separately.

## 2026-05-05 dformerv2_dgc_af_plus run01-run04 summary

- model: `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus`

- conclusion: negative repeated-run result. The original run01 was a high single run, but the four-run mean does not beat the repeated DFormerv2 mid-fusion baseline.
- next step: do not claim DGC-AF++ as a stable paper improvement. Either return to the stronger repeated baseline or design a smaller targeted ablation that specifically improves late-epoch stability without adding global residual controllers.

## 2026-05-05 dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_csg_run02

- model: `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_csg`
- change: DGC-AF++ with cross-stage semantic guidance from DFormerv2 c4 global context injected into each stage's residual generation.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`
- recorded validation epochs: `50`
- best val/mIoU: `0.506402` at recorded epoch `50`
- last val/mIoU: `0.506402`
- best val/loss: `1.054549` at recorded epoch `8`
- comparison baseline mean best: `0.513406`
- delta vs baseline mean: `-0.007004`
- comparison DGC-AF++ run01 best: `0.513584`
- delta vs DGC-AF++ run01: `-0.007182`
- comparison GRM-ARD run01 best: `0.507743`
- delta vs GRM-ARD run01: `-0.001341`
- partial retry note: `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_csg_run01` recorded 33 validation epochs and reached best recorded val/mIoU `0.506047`; it is not used as the final result.
- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_csg_run02.md`
- conclusion: negative result. Cross-stage c4 semantic guidance did not improve DGC-AF++; it underperforms the repeated baseline mean, DGC-AF++ run01, DGC-AF Full run01, and PG-SparseComp run01.
- next step: do not promote CSG as the main branch. Keep `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus` as the current best self-designed candidate and prioritize repeated DGC-AF++ runs or a lighter ablation of semantic guidance.

## 2026-05-04 dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_grm_ard_run01

- model: `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_grm_ard`
- change: DGC-AF++ with depthwise multi-scale relation context, primary-guided residual anchor, guided/support/detail residual mixture, residual budget gate, and soft adaptive bad residual suppression.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`
- recorded validation epochs: `50`

- delta vs DGC-AF Full run01: `-0.005023`
- comparison PG-SparseComp run01 best: `0.511478`
- delta vs PG-SparseComp run01: `-0.003735`
- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_grm_ard_run01.md`
- conclusion: negative result. The heavier GRM/ARD residual-control chain underperforms DGC-AF++, DGC-AF Full, PG-SparseComp, and the repeated baseline mean.
- next step: do not promote this branch. Keep `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus` as the current best single-run candidate; if debugging GRM/ARD later, first ablate mixture gate, budget gate, and ARD separately.

## 2026-05-04 dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_run01

- model: `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus`
- change: DGC-AF++ with asymmetric depth rectification, Gemini-style noise-vs-depth relation selection, support/conflict decomposition, soft sparse support selection, and small detail correction residual.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`
- recorded validation epochs: `50`
- best val/mIoU: `0.513584` at recorded epoch `50`
- last val/mIoU: `0.513584`
- best val/loss: `1.034468` at recorded epoch `8`
- comparison baseline mean best: `0.513406`
- delta vs baseline mean: `+0.000178`
- comparison DGC-AF Full run01 best: `0.512766`

- comparison PG-SparseComp run01 best: `0.511478`
- delta vs PG-SparseComp run01: `+0.002105`
- comparison SA-Gate five-run mean best: `0.513216`
- delta vs SA-Gate five-run mean: `+0.000368`
- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_dgc_af_plus_run01.md`
- conclusion: promising single-run result. It is the first recent DFormerv2-primary residual compensation variant to slightly exceed the repeated baseline mean, but the margin is too small to claim stable improvement without repeated runs.
- next step: run repeated seeds for `dformerv2_dgc_af_plus`; if the mean remains above `0.513406`, promote it to the main candidate branch, otherwise analyze whether the epoch-50 jump is seed variance.

## 2026-05-04 dformerv2_dgc_af_full_run01

- model: `dformerv2_dgc_af_full`
- change: DFormerv2-guided cyclic attention fusion with residual-safe depth cleaning, pixel-wise cross attention, support/conflict decomposition, and soft sparse residual compensation.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`
- recorded validation epochs: `50`
- best val/mIoU: `0.512766` at recorded epoch `47`
- last val/mIoU: `0.477881`
- best val/loss: `1.036298` at recorded epoch `7`
- comparison baseline mean best: `0.513406`
- delta vs baseline mean: `-0.000640`
- comparison PG-SparseComp run01 best: `0.511478`
- delta vs PG-SparseComp run01: `+0.001288`
- comparison gated co-attention run01 partial best: `0.483357`
- delta vs gated co-attention partial: `+0.029409`
- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_dgc_af_full_run01.md`
- conclusion: near-baseline and slightly better than PG-SparseComp run01, but still below the repeated baseline mean. Do not claim as a valid improvement without repeated runs.
- next step: run repeated seeds before changing architecture further; if repeats remain close but below baseline, inspect whether the residual gate opens too late or whether late-epoch overfitting causes the last-epoch drop.

## 2026-05-04 dformerv2_pg_sparse_comp_fusion_run01

- model: `dformerv2_pg_sparse_comp_fusion`
- change: DFormerv2 primary-guided sparse depth residual compensation without `GatedFusion`.
- settings: `batch_size=2`, `max_epochs=50`, `lr=6e-5`, `num_workers=4`, `early_stop_patience=30`
- pretrained: `C:/Users/qintian/Desktop/qintian/dformer_work/checkpoints/pretrained/DFormerv2_Small_pretrained.pth`

- last val/mIoU: `0.471010`
- best val/loss: `1.028691` at recorded epoch `10`
- comparison baseline mean best: `0.513406`
- delta vs baseline mean: `-0.001928`
- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_pg_sparse_comp_fusion_run01.md`
- conclusion: near-baseline but not improved. The primary-guided sparse residual branch is much healthier than the deprecated gated co-attention residual branch, but this single run should be treated as neutral/negative until repeated runs prove a higher mean.
- next step: do not claim as paper improvement. If continuing this direction, first inspect reliability/gamma behavior or run repeats before adding heavier attention.

- evidence: `miou_list/dformerv2_sagate_token_fusion_run01.md`
- conclusion: negative result. The TokenFusion-style selector did not improve the stable baseline and should not be continued in this exact form.
