# Experiment Loop Log

This is the top-level ledger for the Goal-Driven RGB-D mIoU loop.

Current phase: architecture and file initialization only. No full train has been started by this orchestration setup.

Goal: `val/mIoU >= 0.53`.

Baseline reference:

- Active baseline: `dformerv2_mid_fusion`
- Clean 10-run mean best val/mIoU: `0.517397`
- Population std: `0.004901`
- Best single baseline run: `0.524425`
- Existing evidence: `final daima/miou_list/dformerv2_mid_fusion_gate_baseline_summary_run01_09_run10_retry.md`
